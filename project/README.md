## Project Description

The Seneca Library Application is a comprehensive library management system I developed as part of my advanced studies in C++. This project demonstrates my capability in handling complex software development tasks, including object-oriented programming, data management, and user interaction. The application efficiently manages library operations like tracking publications, lending books and periodicals, and handling returns.

### Key Features:

**Modular Design**: 
  The project is structured into several milestones, each adding functionality and complexity, highlighting an incremental development approach.
  
**Streamable Interface**: 
  Custom IO operations for library items are managed through a Streamable interface, showcasing polymorphic behavior.
  
**Dynamic Memory Management**: 
  The application uses dynamic memory allocation efficiently, demonstrating the use of smart pointers and memory management techniques.
  
**User Interaction**: 
  Features a user-friendly, console-based interface that facilitates easy navigation and operation of library management tasks.
  
**Error Handling**: 
  Incorporates comprehensive error checking and validation to ensure the reliability and robustness of the application.
